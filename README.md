This is the TicTacToe. A little project that helps me grow as a developer.

WORD BEFORE:
	This project might be just a fnny thing made to get a great grade at my info class, to impress evreyone else and especially develop my skills whane it comes to coding visualization, and other things like creating an optimal algorithm and start my practice time for when I will really need it.

 WHAT TOOLS YOU NEED TO USE THIS PROGRAM:
	 Basically you just need a wi-fi connection, the rules of TicTacToe in your mind and a mouse :).

HOW THIS GAME WAS BUILT:
	Well, I built this game just for fun.
	I started creating the grid and then I started building the logical part that is behind what the user sees.
	I used a special function from this framework to be able to detect when the mouse is clicked and with every click the current player was changed (e.g. current player = player1 => current player = player2). With every click I draw the relevant figure for every player and after every click I checked if there is a potential winner, with a funtion that was hard-coded.

	If you want more details you can take a look on the code, that was built in p5.js, a JavaScript framework special made for designers, developers and beginners
